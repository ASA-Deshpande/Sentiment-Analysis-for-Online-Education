# Emotion-Analysis-for-Online-Classes

Emotion is one of the very few words in the English language that does not have a concrete definition. Yet, almost every decision we have ever made in our lives is driven by emotion. This project proposes Face Emotion Recognition (FER) model to extract and classify the emotions from an image. The working of algorithm for both videos and images is the same. This can further be used to analyse the satisfaction levels of students learning remotely using online tools.
